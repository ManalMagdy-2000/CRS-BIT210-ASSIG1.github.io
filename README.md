Crisis Relief Services (CRS) is an NGO (Non-Government Organization) that aims to help people who are facing crises arising from natural disasters such as flood and earthquakes. The CRS staff consists of managers and administrators, and they are governed by a Board of Directors. CRS staff will take the lead to organize a trip to the disaster area to provide relief services. CRS has a large pool of volunteers, and they will send out a notification to all the volunteers. Volunteers who wish to join trips will have to possess the necessary skills, for example for flood-hit areas they should be skilled swimmers, or have a lifesaving certificate. Volunteers may submit documents to verify their skills, or may need to submit other documents such as passport information if the trips are to other countries. There will usually be a limit on the number of volunteers to join a trip, so the staff responsible for the trip will review the applications and check that the volunteers have the necessary skills.
